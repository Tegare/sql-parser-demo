## üìã Features

The sql-parser-demo is designed to help you understand how parsing works. Here are some features you can explore:

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple navigation to help you easily use the application.
- **Demo Parsing**: See how different SQL queries are parsed.
- **Example Outputs**: Explore sample results to understand the parser's functionality.
- **Educational Resources**: Links to resources for deeper learning about parsing and Rust.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while downloading or running the application, here are some common solutions:

- **File Won't Open**: Make sure your file downloaded completely. If not, try downloading it again.
- **Permission Denied**: If you receive a permission error, ensure you have rights to run the file. On Linux, you may need to run `chmod +x your-file-name` to make it executable.
- **Missing Dependencies**: If the application does not run, make sure your system meets the requirements listed above.
